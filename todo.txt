- from demo to ptc vimmers
    - direct symbol search (add 'viw' to search expression?)
    - doc search directly in vim (pdocs)
    - convenient way to run ptags in loop mode while vim is running
    - ptags can be run without docker for speed?
- make it truly iterateable, outputting not only at the end
    - this would make fzf nicer as it builds up
- maybe make a fzf mode anyway, don't have to follow ctags format anymore
    - make different formats better, or different subcommands? for streaming and stuff?
- switch to python3.7
