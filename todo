- from demo to ptc vimmers
    - direct symbol search (add 'viw' to search expression?)
    - doc search directly in vim (pdocs)
    - convenient way to run ptags in loop mode while vim is running
    - ptags can be run without docker for speed?
- make it truly iterateable, outputting not only at the end
    - this would make fzf nicer as it builds up
- maybe make a fzf mode anyway, don't have to follow ctags format anymore
    - make different formats better, or different subcommands? for streaming and stuff?
- switch to python3.7

- make it use a dedicated pipx-like or with-python venv?
    - so we go with most recent
    - but any 3.x is supported for parsing
    - pipx-like will be nice for people to start using it
    - could work both from local, even editable? but also for pip

- of course we still got problems
    - any file that has a syntax error kills everything
    - first skip it?
    - second see if we could keep previous output?
    - third see if we can remove a few lines and still parse?
    - fourth any forgiving parsers?
