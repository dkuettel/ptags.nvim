general:
- dev env is problematic, vim sees the dev ptags
- in vim, ptags doesnt fill content until the first key, probably a telescope problem?
- the readme image is not a good demo, doesnt show very fully-qualified stuff
o why no good message when non-zero?
    - is that telescope's business to react to?
    - give stderr if any
    - actually funky-formatter should do the same? maybe?
- more generic
    - could we just base it on each language's tag.scm or something? with stack based scope?

feeback for readme:
- Plug 'dkuettel/ptags.nvim', {'do': './setup'}
- ptags imported
- make gif for the demo
- telescope fuzzy matching can be more awesome
