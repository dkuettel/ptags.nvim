general:
o tree-sitter
    o actually try the stack based
    - compare start/end pos (only end pos) to unstack scopes
    - should be a tiny bit more efficient, shorter even?
o why no good message when non-zero?
    - is that telescope's business to react to?
    - give stderr if any
    - actually funky-formatter should do the same? maybe?
o old notes
    - builtin.treesitter() could be adapted to make things fully qualified?
    - function make_entry.gen_from_treesitter(opts) could be interesting for generic tags? if we collect parent identifiers. and faster than the lsps probably, with fully qualified elements
- more generic
    - could we just base it on each language's tag.scm or something? with stack based scope?


feeback for readme:
- Plug paste from hemanth
    - Plug 'dkuettel/ptags.nvim', {'do': './setup'}
- ptags imported
- make gif for the demo
- telescope fuzzy matching can be more awesome
- advertise fzf for hemanth
